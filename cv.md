## About Me
👋 Hi, my name is Stan! As a Web & UI/UX Designer and Digital Marketer, I help businesses to succeed in digital culture and to add value to their product or service. For over the past 5 years I have dealt with various projects in different areas of business including VR, crypto, startups, delivery services, E-commerce, etc.

🌎 I’ve had the pleasure to collaborate with teams and individual clients from the USA, Canada, New Zealand, Ukraine, Germany, Latvia, and Estonia.

❤️ When I started studying programming, a new world opened up for me. The idea of creating something from scratch just with code excites me, that's why I'm here.

### Description
Function `makeItFunny()` takes a string as argument
and returns a copy of it but each 'n' element of the string is converted to Upper Case.

```
const makeItFunny = (str, n) => {
let result = '';

for (let i = 0; i < str.length; i++) {
    const current = str[i];
    if ((i + 1) % n === 0) {
      result = `${result}${current.toUpperCase()}`;
    } else { result = `${result}${current}`; }
}
  return result;
};
